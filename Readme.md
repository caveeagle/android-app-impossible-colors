## Impossible Colors (Forbidden Colors)

**Impossible colors** are subjective color sensations that cannot be experienced under normal vision. The technology for demonstrating impossible colors is based on **separate stimulation of each eye**. Each eye is presented with a pure, saturated color from an opponent pair (for example, yellow to one eye and blue to the other). There is no physical mixing of colors: each eye receives an independent signal. The brain tries to combine these incompatible inputs, which under certain conditions can lead to an unusual color perception.

In practice, **binocular rivalry** is most commonly observed—a rapid alternation of perception between one color and the other. However, with stable fixation, minimal eye movement, and proper stimulus geometry, some people briefly experience a new, “indescribable” color that cannot be matched to either of the originals.

This application implements this principle by displaying color stimuli as separate circles to each eye. It is designed for experimental demonstration of the peculiarities of human color perception and does not guarantee the same effect for all users.
